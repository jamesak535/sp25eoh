## Key Features

- ðŸ§ª Interactive Molecular Design Interface
- ðŸ¤– Real-time Machine Learning Predictions
- ðŸ“Š Dynamic Leaderboard System
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Research

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-ui

### Backend
- Python
- Flask
- Machine Learning Models (Random Forest)
- RDKit
- TensorFlow

### Research Methodology
- QSAR Modeling
- Molecular Fingerprint Analysis
- IC50 Value Prediction

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm
- Python 3.8+

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the backend server
python backend/api.py
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Replace IP configuration
# Edit frontend/src/config.ts and replace "YOUR_IP" with your local IP address

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## How to Play

1. Open the web application
2. Design your molecular structure
3. Submit your molecule
4. Receive instant IC50 prediction
5. Compare your results on the leaderboard
6. Iterate and improve your designs

## Hosting the Game

To host the game on your local network:

1. Replace the IP address in `frontend/src/config.ts` with your machine's IP address

2. Start the backend API:
```bash
python backend/api.py
```

3. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
